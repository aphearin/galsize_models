\begin{abstract}
We derive empirical modeling constraints on the connection between dark matter halos and the half-light radius of galaxies, $\rhalf.$ Novel to this work, we study galaxy size using new SDSS measurements of the $\rhalf-$dependence of galaxy clustering. Smaller galaxies cluster stronger relative to larger galaxies of the same stellar mass, a new result. We use {\tt Halotools} to test a collection of forward models of galaxy size to identify the qualitative ingredients needed to reproduce the observed clustering. We show that the $\rhalf-$dependence of galaxy clustering is largely driven by centrals being larger than satellite galaxies of the same halo mass. Models in which $\rhalf$ is determined by stellar mass $\mstar$ exhibit qualitatively discrepant clustering properties from SDSS galaxies. Models where $\rhalf$ is linearly proportional to halo virial radius $\rvir$ at the time of peak halo mass are much more successful, provided that scatter in $\rhalf$ is significantly correlated with the halo scale radius $R_{\rm s}$ at that time. Together with the result that stellar mass stripping of satellites has only a mild impact on $\rhalf-$dependent clustering, this suggests that the relative size of centrals and satellites is already in place at the time of satellite infall, and supports the notion that $L_{\ast}$ galaxy and halo profiles co-evolve across many Gyr of cosmic time. 
%Our results can be treated as a boundary condition for more complex and fine-grained models of galaxy size, and provide a simple means for cosmological surveys to generate synthetic galaxy populations with realistic sizes across the cosmic web.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Some introduction goes here.

\section{Data and Simulations}
\label{sec:data}

Our galaxy sample comes from the catalog of SDSS galaxy profile decompositions provided by \citet{meert_etal15}. This catalog is based on Data Release 10 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep[SDSS,][]{ahn_etal14}, with improvements to the photometry pipeline and light profile fitting methods \citep{vikram_etal10,bernardi_etal13,bernardi_etal14,meert_etal13}. In the version of this catalog that we use, two-dimensional $r-$band profiles were fit with a two-component de Vaucouleurs + exponential profile to determine the half-light radius $\rhalf.$ We apply the \citet{bell_etal03} mass-to-light ratio to the $r-$band flux and $g-r$ colors in this catalog to obtain an estimate for the total stellar mass $\mstar$ of every galaxy. We calculate two-point clustering $\wproj$ of our SDSS galaxy sample using line-of-sight projection of $\pi_{\rm max}=20\mpc$ using the {\tt correl} program in {\tt UniverseMachine}. 

As the bedrock of our modeling, we use the catalog of {\tt Rockstar} subhalos identified at $z=0$ in the Bolshoi-Planck simulation \citep{klypin_etal11,behroozi12_rockstar,behroozi12_consistent_trees,riebe_etal13,rodriguez_puebla16_bolplanck}. The particular version of the catalog we use is made publicly available through {\tt Halotools} \citep{hearin_etal16}, with {\tt version\_name} = `halotools\_v0p4'. 

We additionally explore the potential existence of satellite galaxies that reside in subhalos that are not identified by halo-finder to the present day, so-called ``orphan galaxies" \citep[see, e.g.,][]{campbell_etal17}. We use an extension of {\tt Consistent Trees} that models the evolution of subhalos after disruption. The phase space evolution of orphans is approximated by following a point mass evolving in the host halo potential according to the orbital parameters of the subhalo at the time of disruption; the evolution of subhalo mass and circular velocity is approximated using the semi-analytic model presented in \citet{jiang_vdB14}.   

For mock galaxies, to compute galaxy clustering we employ the distant observer approximation by treating the simulation $z-$axis as the line-of-sight. We compute $\wproj$ using the {\tt mock\_observables.wp} function in {\tt Halotools}, which is a python implementation of the algorithm in the {\tt Corrfunc} C library \citep{sinha_etal17}. 

All numerical values of $\rhalf$ will be quoted in physical $\kpc,$ and all values of $\mstar$ and $\mhalo$ in $\msun,$ assuming $H_0=67.8~\kms\equiv100h~\kms,$ the best-fit value from \citet{planck15}. To scale stellar masses to ``$h=1$ units" \citep{croton13}, our numerically quoted values for $\mstar$ should be multiplied by a factor of $h^2,$ while our halo masses and distances should be multiplied by a factor of $h.$


\section{Galaxy-Halo Model}
\label{sec:model}

\subsection{Stellar mass model}
\label{subsec:smhm}

We map $\mstar$ onto subhalos with the best-fit stellar-to-halo mass relation from \citet{moster_etal13}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:smhm}
\langle\mstar/\mhalo\rangle = 2N\left[(\mhalo/M_{1})^{-\beta} + (\mhalo/M_1)^{\gamma}\right]^{-1}.
\end{equation}
For halo mass $\mhalo$ we use $\mpeak,$ the largest value of $\mvir$ ever attained along the main progenitor branch of the subhalo. 

The values of the best-fit parameters in \citet{moster_etal13} were fit to a stellar mass function (SMF) with values $\mstar^{\rm MPA-JHU}$ based on the MPA-JHU catalog \citep{kauffmann_etal03,brinchmann_etal04}, which differs from the SMF in our galaxy sample \citep[see, e.g.,][]{bernardi_etal14}. We account for this difference by manually tabulating the median value $\langle\mstar^{\rm Meert+15}\vert\mstar^{\rm MPA-JHU}\rangle$ in logarithmic bins spanning $9 < \log_{10}\mstar^{\rm MPA-JHU}/\msun < 12,$ and applying the median correction to the Monte Carlo realization of the mock galaxy sample. This results in a typical boost of $\sim0.25$ dex at $\mstar^{\rm MPA-JHU}\approx10^{9.75}\msun,$ and $\sim0.4$ dex at $\mstar^{\rm MPA-JHU}\approx10^{11.5}\msun.$ 

\subsection{Galaxy size models}
\label{subsec:model}

In \S\ref{sec:results}, we calculate predictions for the $\rhalf-$dependence of galaxy clustering for several different kinds of empirical models, described in turn below.


\subsubsection{$\mstar-$only model}
\label{subsubsec:mstaronlymodel}

In the first class of models we explore, we suppose that stellar mass $\mstar$ is the statistical regulator of $\rhalf,$ so that galaxy sizes are drawn from a log-normal distribution centered at $\langle\rhalf\vert\mstar\rangle,$ where $\mstar$ derives from the \citet{moster_etal13} relation described above in \S\ref{subsec:smhm}. To implement this model, for simplicity we directly tabulate $\langle\rhalf\vert\mstar\rangle$ from the data, rather than pursue a parametric form \citep[see, e.g.,][]{zhang_yang17}. 

\subsubsection{$\rvir-$only model}
\label{subsubsec:rvirmodel}

In \citet{kravtsov13}, it was found that if a stellar-to-halo mass relation is inverted to map halo mass estimates $\mhalo$ onto SDSS galaxies, and then the $\mhalo-\rvir$ relation is applied to map values of $\rvir$ onto the galaxies, then the resulting $\rhalf-\rvir$ relation of SDSS galaxies exhibits the following linear scaling across a wide range of stellar mass:
\beq
\label{eq:fiducial_model}
\rhalf = 0.0125\rvir
\eeq

Motivated by the simplicity of this scaling relation, we transform the \citet{kravtsov13} into a forward model using {\tt Halotools}. For the virial radius of halos and subhalos, we use $\rmpeak,$ the value of $\rvir$ in physical units of $\kpc$ measured at the time of peak subhalo mass, defined by 

\beq
\mpeak\equiv\frac{4\pi}{3}\rmpeak^{3}\Delta_{\rm vir}(\zpeak)\rho_{\rm m}(\zpeak), 
\eeq
where for $\Delta_{\rm vir}(\zpeak)$ we use the fitting function to the ``virial" definition used in \citet{bryan_norman98}. For the model we refer to as the ``$\rvir-$only model", we add uncorrelated log-normal scatter of $\sigmarhalf=0.2$ dex to generate a Monto Carlo realization of the model population. 

\subsubsection{Profile co-evolution model}
\label{subsubsec:coevolutionmodel}

The ``profile co-evolution" model is identical to the $\rvir-$only model, but the scatter in $\rhalf$ at fixed $\rmpeak$ is no longer purely stochastic, and is instead correlated with $\vmaxmpeak,$ defined as the value of $\vmax$ at $\zpeak.$ In this way, $\rmpeak$ statistically determines the distribution of available sizes, but halos with extended dark matter profiles and large scale radii $R_{\rm s}$ host galaxies with above-average sizes, while halos with small $R_{\rm s}$ host smaller galaxies. See Figure \ref{fig:coevolutionmodel} for a visual illustration of this residual correlation. We implement scatter correlations using the {\tt halotools.empirical\_models.conditional\_abunmatch} function, which generalizes the Conditional Abundance Matching technique described in \citet{hearin_etal13b}. 

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{FIGS/rs_correlation_visual.pdf}
\caption{
{\bf Profile co-evolution model.} In this model, the log-normal distribution of galaxy sizes is determined by $\rmpeak,$ the physical size of the halo virial radius at the time the halo reaches its peak mass. Thus log-normal the shape of this curve is determined by $\langle\rhalf\vert\rmpeak\rangle=0.0125\rmpeak$ with $0.2$ dex of scatter. The profile co-evolution model further supposes that galaxy and halo profiles co-evolve across cosmic time. Thus within this log-normal distribution, for two halos with the same $\rmpeak,$ halos with larger scale radius at $\zpeak$ will host galaxies with above-average $\rhalf,$ and conversely for halos with smaller values of $\rspeak.$ 
}
\label{fig:coevolutionmodel}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{$\mstar-$stripping model}
\label{subsubsec:strippingmodel}

As we will show in \S\ref{sec:results}, the chief ingredient needed to recover the observed clustering properties of galaxies is that satellites need to be smaller than centrals of comparable halo mass. Thus it is natural to consider a class of models in which stellar mass is stripped from satellite galaxies after infall. 

The basis of this class of models is the fitting function presented in \citet{smith_etal16}, which was calibrated by studying stellar mass loss in a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. In this model, $f_{\ast}$ quantifies the fraction of stellar mass lost as a function of $f_{\rm DM},$ the amount of dark matter that has been stripped since infall:

\beq
f_{\ast} = 1 - \exp(-14.2f_{\rm DM})
\eeq
For $f_{\rm DM}$ we use the ratio of present-day subhalo mass divided by the peak mass, $M_{\rm vir}/M_{\rm peak}.$ If we denote the post-stripping stellar mass as $M_{\ast}',$ then we have $M_{\ast}'\equiv f_{\ast}M_{\ast},$ where $M_{\ast}$ is given by Eq.~\ref{eq:smhm}. We then calculate the post-stripping radius by interpolating $\langle\rhalf'\vert\mstar'\rangle$ directly from SDSS data. 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In \S\ref{subsec:predictions} we show comparisons between the galaxy size models described in \S\ref{sec:model} and our SDSS sample. 

\subsection{Testing Model Predictions}
\label{subsec:predictions}

In Figure \ref{fig:scatter_plot} we show the scaling of galaxy size $\rhalf$ with $\mstar.$ The black curve enveloped by the gray bands show the scaling relation for our SDSS galaxy sample, while the blue curve shows the median relation $\langle\rhalf\vert\mstar\rangle$ implied by the profile co-evolution model described in \S\ref{sec:model}. This figure shows that models in which $\rhalf\propto\rvir$ can naturally give rise to the characteristic curvature in the $\langle\rhalf\vert\mstar\rangle$ relation, confirming the results in \citet{kravtsov13} in a forward modeling context. 

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{FIGS/rhalf_vs_mstar_fiducial_model.pdf}
\caption{The black curve shows the median $\rhalf-\mstar$ relation SDSS galaxies as measured in \citet{meert_etal15}. The two gray bands enveloping the black curve show the $50\%$ and $90\%$ percentile regions. The blue curve shows profile co-evolution model in which $\langle\rhalf\vert\rvir\rangle=0.0125\rvir,$ as in \citet{kravtsov13}. This figure confirms that a linear relationship between $\rvir$ and $\rhalf,$ convolved against the nonlinear relationships between $\rvir, \mhalo$ and $\mstar,$  predicts the characteristic curvature in the relation $\langle\rhalf\vert\mstar\rangle$ over a wide range in mass.
}
\label{fig:scatter_plot}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Figure \ref{fig:clustering_ratio_upshot} we present new measurements of the $\rhalf-$dependence of projected galaxy clustering, $\wproj(\rproj).$ Because galaxy clustering has well-known dependence upon $\mstar$ that is not the subject of this work, we wish to remove this influence and focus purely on the relationship between $\rhalf$ and $\wproj(\rproj).$ To do so, we determine the value $\langle\rhalf\vert\mstar\rangle$ by computing a sliding median of $\rhalf,$ calculated using a window of width $N_{\rm gal}=1000.$ Each galaxy is categorized as either ``large" or ``small" according to whether it is above or below the median value appropriate for its stellar mass. For any $\mstar-$threshold sample, the SMF of the ``large" and ``small" subsamples are identical, by construction. 

We measure $\wproj(\rproj)$ separately for large and small subsamples for four different $\mstar$ thresholds, $\mstar>10^{9.75}\msun,$ $\mstar>10^{10.25}\msun,$ $\mstar>10^{10.75}\msun,$ and $\mstar>10^{11.25}\msun.$ We make the same measurements for each volume-limited $\mstar-$threshold sample {\em without} splitting on size, giving us measurements $\wpall, \wplarge,$ and $\wpsmall$ for each threshold sample. This allow us to compute the ratio $(\wplarge-\wpsmall)/\wpall,$ which we refer to as {\em the $\rhalf$ clustering ratio}. These ratios are the measurements appearing on the y-axis in each panel of Figure \ref{fig:clustering_ratio_upshot}. Points with error bars show SDSS measurements, solid curves show the clustering ratios of model galaxies as predicted by the models described in \S\ref{sec:model}. 

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{FIGS/penultimate_clustering_ratios_no_orphans.pdf}
\caption{
{\bf $\rhalf-$dependence of galaxy clustering.}
Points with error bars show new SDSS measurements of the $\rhalf-$dependence of projected galaxy clustering, $\wproj,$ compared to predictions by the model tuned to the measurements shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:scatter_plot}. We define a galaxy as ``large" or ``small" according to whether it is above or below the median size for its stellar mass, so that in each panel, the SMF of the ``large" and ``small" subsamples are identical, as described in the text. The y-axis shows {\em clustering strength ratios,} so that, for example, a y-axis value of $-0.5$ corresponds to small galaxies being $50\%$ more strongly clustered than large galaxies of comparable stellar mass. Each panel shows results separately for a different volume-limited $\mstar-$threshold samples. See \S\ref{subsec:model} for a description of each model.}
\label{fig:clustering_ratio_upshot}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The salient feature of the clustering ratio measurements is that they are negative: small galaxies cluster more strongly than large galaxies of the same stellar mass, a new result. This feature also holds true for model galaxies. This result may be surprising, since $\rhalf\propto\rvir,$ halo mass $\rvir\propto\mhalo^{1/3},$ and clustering strength increases with $\mvir.$ Based on this simple argument, one would expect the opposite trend to the measurements shown here. 

A straightforward resolution to this puzzle is shown in Figure \ref{fig:censatsizehist}. 

\subsection{Origin of the size-dependence of galaxy clustering}
\label{subsec:shuffle_tests}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{FIGS/cen_sat_sizes.pdf}
\caption{
{\bf Relative sizes of centrals and satellites.} In a narrow bin of halo mass $\mhalo=\mpeak\approx10^{12}\msun,$ we show the distribution of model galaxy sizes for different subpopulations galaxies. The red histogram shows the sizes of satellites; the blue histogram shows host halos that have never passed inside the virial radius of a larger halo (``true centrals"); the green histogram host halos that were subhalos inside a larger at some point in their past history (``splashback halos"). In the fiducial model, galaxy size is set by the physical size of the virial radius at the time the (sub)halo attains its peak mass, naturally resulting in smaller sizes for satellites and backsplash centrals relative to true centrals of the same $\mpeak.$
}
\label{fig:censatsizehist}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%We can understand the origin of the shape of the clustering strength ratios shown in Figure~\ref{fig:clustering_ratio_upshot} through a series of straightforward ``shuffle tests". The points with error bars and solid curves in each panel of Fig.\ref{fig:shuffle} are identical to those appearing in Fig.\ref{fig:clustering_ratio_upshot}, although the dynamic range of the y-axis has changed to accommodate the additional curves. 

%We generated each additional curve by variations on the following exercise. In logarithmic bins of $\mpeak$ with width of $0.1$dex, we randomly shuffle the modeled $\rhalf$ values of some particular subpopulation of model galaxies that reside in subhalos in the $\mpeak$ bin. After repeating this shuffle over the entire range of $\mpeak,$ we then re-divide model galaxies into ``large" and ``small" populations, and remeasure the clustering strength ratios. By shuffling sizes amongst different subpopulations, we can gain an understanding of the subhalo properties that contribute to the characteristic shape of the clustering ratios. 

%In the {\em brown, dotted} curves labeled ``all-gal scramble", we shuffle the sizes of {\em all} model galaxies in the $\mpeak$ bin, so that in the resulting mock, galaxy size has no correlation with any subhalo property beyond $\mpeak.$ In particular, the ``all-gal scramble" mock erases the possible influence of a correlation between galaxy size and the redshift at which the subhalo attains peak mass. The resulting clustering strength ratios become exactly as predicted by the naive expectation sketched at the conclusion of \S\ref{subsec:predictions}: $\rhalf\propto\rvir\propto\mhalo^{1/3},$ and so large galaxies clustering more strongly relative to small galaxies of comparable stellar mass. 

%Statistically, there are actually two distinct effects at work in the ``all-gal scramble".  Central and satellite galaxies of similar $\mpeak$ have their sizes shuffled amongst each other, and the potential influence of central galaxy assembly bias is also erased. We parse these separate effects by exploring three variations on the shuffle tests, described below. 

%For the {\em cyan dashed} curve labeled ``all-cen-scramble", we only shuffle sizes amongst present-day host halos, i.e., amongst subhalos for which Rockstar {\tt upid} equals -1. For the {\em black dashed} curve labeled ``true-cen-scramble", we only shuffle amongst host halos that have never passed within the virial radius of a larger halo throughout their entire assembly history, i.e., we only shuffle amongst non-backsplash host halos. Finally, the {\em purple dot-dashed} curve labeled ``sat-scramble", we only shuffle sizes amongst satellite galaxies, i.e., subhalos that are presently located inside the virial radius of a larger halo. 

% shown in Figure \ref{fig:shuffle}. 


%In light of this explanation, it is natural to ask whether this simple feature {\em alone} is all that is needed for any model of $\rhalf$ to achieve this level of success at predicting galaxy clustering on small and large scales. We address this question in \S~\ref{subsec:tests2} below, finding that the answer is no: the reasonably correct magnitude and scale-dependence of the clustering ratios predicted by our model is a non-trivial result that places tight constraints on the post-infall physics of satellite galaxies.

%We conclude this section by estimating how satellite mass stripping manifests in $\wproj(\rproj).$ To do so, we construct an extension our fiducial model with a simple additional ingredient for post-infall evolution of satellites mass and size. 

%In the fiducial model described in \S~\ref{sec:model}, recall that in the power law a scaling relations (Eq.~\ref{eq:fiducial_model}) the halo radius $\rvir$ used for satellite galaxies is taken to be the value at the time of infall. The simple interpretation of this assumption is that, in a statistical sense, the size of satellite galaxies is determined by its history as a central galaxy, and that post-infall physics leaves no distinct imprint on satellite $\rhalf.$

%Here we suppose that this assumption is violated, and that $\rhalf$ decreases after infall according to $(\mvir/\macc)^{1/3}.$ That is, in this alternative formulation, rather than using $\rvir$ at the time of infall for satellites in the power law scaling relations, we instead use $\rvir(\mvir/\macc)^{1/3}.$ This simple toy model attempts supposes that the same physical processes leading to halo mass loss are also responsible for a post-infall decrease in satellite size.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


%Figure~\ref{fig:satellites} compares the clustering ratios of our fiducial model (solid curves) to the clustering ratios of this alternative model (dashed curves). The difference between the small-scale clustering of the two models is stark: the assumption that $\rhalf$ decreases after infall leaves a strong imprint on the $\rhalf-$dependence of $\wproj(\rproj),$ such that small galaxies cluster {\em much} more strongly relative to large galaxies, particularly for disk-dominated systems with $\mstar\approx10^{10}\msun.$

%The large differences between the solid and dashed curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:satellites} establishes that the largely successful prediction for the clustering ratios fiducial model is a non-trivial: $\wproj(\rproj)$ is indeed providing good constraining power on the  assumptions underlying our profile modeling and not simply our morphology modeling, c.f., \S\ref{subsubsec:random_bt_model} and \S\ref{sec:model}. We refer the reader to \S\ref{subsec:satellite_discussion} for further discussion of the physical implications of this result.
